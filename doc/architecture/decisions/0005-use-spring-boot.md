# 5. use Spring boot

Date: 2020-10-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Developer time is at a premium, and no one likes configuring the myriad of options Spring provides.

## Decision

We will use Spring boot.


## Consequences
It helps get us to hit the ground running and speeds up development considerably.

It abstracts a lot of settings that might impact the application's performance from the developer.
